            <p>This is Matthew Wilcken. I live in Rexburg, Idaho and am currently the chief accountant at Connextion Property Management. I am single and in my early 40's. I have a Philosophy degree from BYU-Provo. My orignal goal was to co-major in Philosophy and Computer Science. Sadly, time-constraints put a damper on that.</p>
            <p>While in attendance at BYU-Provo, I took Digital Humanities, wherein I studied webiste design. This was nearly 10 years ago, however, so I feel the review is necessary. But, we all know the addage of riding a bike...</p>
            <p>My goal in taking WDD 130 is to not only refresh my memeory but, perhaps, learn something new about web design. My ultimate goal with Pathway is to earn a second degree, this time in STEM.</p>
