            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Matthew Wilcken" width="200">
            <p>This is Matthew Wilcken. I live in Rexburg, Idaho and am currently the chief accountant at Connextion Property Management. I am single and in my early 40's. I have a Philosophy degree from BYU-Provo. My orignal goal was to co-major in Philosophy and Computer Science. Sadly, time-constraints put a damper on that.</p>
            <p>While in attendance at BYU-Provo, I took Digital Humanities, wherein I studied webiste design. This was nearly 10 years ago, however, so I feel the review is necessary. But, we all know the addage of riding a bike...</p>
            <p>My goal in taking WDD 130 is to not only refresh my memeory but, perhaps, learn something new about web design. My ultimate goal with Pathway is to earn a second degree, this time in STEM.</p>
            <p>I am also enrolled in CSE110 wherein I am studying Python. I find Pyhton to be an interesting language for coding though I don't like the fact that it is an interpreted language, meaning that the interpreter must report the status of the code execution for each line of code rather than just run as fast as it can like with a complied language.</p>
